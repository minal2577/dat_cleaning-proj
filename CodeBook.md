Description of Variables:

subject: The subject ID (person performing the activity). A numerical variable.
activity: The activity label describing the type of activity being performed. This is a categorical variable with values such as "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", and "LAYING".
tBodyAcc-mean-X: The mean value of the accelerometer signal in the X direction for the body accelerometer.
tBodyAcc-mean-Y: The mean value of the accelerometer signal in the Y direction for the body accelerometer.
tBodyAcc-mean-Z: The mean value of the accelerometer signal in the Z direction for the body accelerometer.
tBodyAcc-std-X: The standard deviation of the accelerometer signal in the X direction for the body accelerometer.
tBodyAcc-std-Y: The standard deviation of the accelerometer signal in the Y direction for the body accelerometer.
tBodyAcc-std-Z: The standard deviation of the accelerometer signal in the Z direction for the body accelerometer.
(Note: These are just a few examples. You would list all the mean and standard deviation features here, which are extracted from the dataset).

Transformations Applied:

Merging the training and test datasets: Combined the test and training datasets into one single dataset.
Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements: The dataset includes many features. The ones that correspond to the mean and standard deviation of measurements have been extracted.
Descriptive Activity Names: Activity IDs have been replaced by descriptive names.
Labeling Data Set with Descriptive Variable Names: Variable names were cleaned up to make them more readable and descriptive.
Creating the Tidy Data Set: The data was grouped by both subject and activity, and then averaged for each variable to create the tidy dataset.
Additional Notes:

The dataset used is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset, which contains measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
This tidy dataset now includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
